# 3d-printed-tweezers
Training task to create 3d model of tweezers and print it  

## Materials and Methods  

PLA filament  
3d printer - Creality Ender-3 V3 SE  
Orcaslicer  
Example image  
Rhinoceros 7  


## Requirements  

1) 40 min to create a model
2) Fast printing (less than 20 min)
3) Make a test

## Create a model  

it's shorter than I wanted, but I had to do it so that I could type it during the lesson

## Slicing  

for this picture, I changed the scale in the slicer to demonstrate the proportions in which I planned to print the model

## Overall  

Modeling, slicing and printing turned out well. If I need a working prototype of tweezers, I will make the cheeks more authentic, as in the picture from the slicer, to ensure better mobility of the device
